# SimpsonsParadox
Find about Simpsons Paradox in my blog https://medium.com/@alabhya/same-data-two-story-an-insight-on-simpson-paradox-f1d64ad360e7 and https://alabhya.medium.com/simpsons-paradox-in-linear-models-dd741b1ffef5.
The R file is the one that I worked with while writing the blog. The Python file is a refined one that I did after everything was done. Python might be more efficient but may be difficult to understand. Read my blog for the article on the Simpsons Paradox.
R and Python may not output the same results since the random seed works differently. Please not that my blog is based on the R version.
